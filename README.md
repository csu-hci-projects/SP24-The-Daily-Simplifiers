3. To run the project, you select one of the .py files from our Github and open it with Thonny editor for Python. You will need to set up a Raspberry Pi 3b in a specific configuration with GPIO port numbers being set to their assigned values in the code. You will need an LED, a button, a resistor, a camera, and a USB mic. Once you have everything configured the way we have it configured in our pictures in the miscellaneous folder, you can plug in the Pi and open Thonny to run the code. Once you are done running the code, you can hit the red stop button to stop the code and exit.
